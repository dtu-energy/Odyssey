On this page, some information and references to the various acquisition functions are provided. 

> **_NOTE:_**  If the acquisition function requires the `best_f` parameter, simply set it to 0.0, and Odyssey will find the current best observation by itself.

> **_NOTE:_** The `model`, `posterior_transform` and `maximize` parameters can be ignored.
